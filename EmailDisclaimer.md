Identifying genuine Smart360 email
----------------------------------

Email from Smart360 can be recognised as originating from one of the following registered domain names: 

- smart-360.co.uk

Your mail provider or SMTP server software may also be able to recognise other hallmarks of genuine Smart360 email, including validation using:

- DomainKey Identified Mail (DKIM) 
- Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) 

Email caveats
-------------

Email is a widely used business communications medium, but it has shortcomings. Smart360 correspondents should be aware of the following potential issues: 

| Privacy |  Parties other than the intended receiver may be able to read email transcripts. As messages traverse the Internet they are sometimes stored and forwarded via intermediate servers, allowing for a 3rd party to record or tamper with the message while it is in transit. |
| Message flow confidentiality | A third party might be able to identify that an email was sent, and who the parties were. Even if the message body remains confidential, someone may be able to know that a communication occurred. |
| Authentication | The receiver cannot necessarily verify the identity of the sender.	|
| Integrity | The receiver cannot be sure that the message has not been altered after leaving the control of the sender. |
| Non-repudiation | The receiver may find it hard to prove that the sender really did author a given message. |
| Proof of submission/delivery | There is no proof that a given message was sent or received at the alleged time. Some organisations will reject requests for a read receipt by policy.	|

Smart360 uses and distributes proprietary software solutions to address many of these issues. 

Email encryption
----------------
Smart360 uses opportunistic TLS encryption to secure email messages in transit.
Smart360 uses an email service which will always try to encrypt connections with the most secure version of TLS first, working down a list of TLS ciphers until one can be found which both parties support. In some cases, the recipient email system will not support TLS at all, causing messages to be transmitted in plain-text.
On an individual message basis, Smart360 may elect to send some correspondence more securely via a proprietary solution with superior end-to-end encryption to TLS. 

Liability
---------
Although Smart360 makes reasonable endeavours to prevent the spread of computer viruses via email, the recipient should always make use of technologies to scan email and attachments for the presence of malicious code.
Smart360 accepts no liability for any damage inadvertently caused by transmission of malware.
Email transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-free as information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses. Smart360 does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of any email message. 

Unintentionally entering in to contracts
----------------------------------------

No employee or agent of Smart360 is authorised to conclude any binding agreement on behalf of Smart360 by email without the expressly written confirmation of a director.
