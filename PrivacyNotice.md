We may process your personal data for the purposes necessary for the performance
of our contract with you. This may include processing your personal data where
you are an associate of our client.

We may process your personal data to comply with our legal obligations.

We may process your personal data for the purposes of our own legitimate
interests provided that those interests do not override any of your own
interests, rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data.
This includes processing for marketing, business development, statistical and
management purposes.

We may process your personal data for certain additional purposes with your
consent, and in these limited circumstances where your consent is required for
the processing of your personal data then you have the right to withdraw your
consent to processing for such specific purposes.

Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful
basis depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

**Situations in which we will use your personal data**

We may use your personal data to:

-   carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between
    you or our clients and us which will most usually be for the provision of
    our services;

-   carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between
    our clients and us (which will most usually be for the provision of our
    services) where you may be a associate of our client;

    activities that you request from us or which we feel may interest you,
    provided your have consented to be contacted for such purposes;

-   seek your thoughts and opinions on the services we provide; and

-   notify you about any changes to our services.

In some circumstances we may anonymise or pseudonymise the personal data so that
it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use it without
further notice to you.

If you refuse to provide us with certain information when requested, we may not
be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you. Alternatively, we
may be unable to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.

We may also process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in
accordance with this notice, where we are legally required or permitted to do
so.

**Data retention**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the
purposes for which it is collected.

When assessing what retention period is appropriate for your personal data, we
take into consideration:

-   the requirements of our business and the services provided;

-   any statutory or legal obligations;

-   the purposes for which we originally collected the personal data;

-   the lawful grounds on which we based our processing;

-   the types of personal data we have collected;

-   the amount and categories of your personal data; and

-   whether the purpose of the processing could reasonably be fulfilled by other
    means.

**Change of purpose**

Where we need to use your personal data for another reason, other than for the
purpose for which we collected it, we will only use your personal data where
that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

Should it be necessary to use your personal data for a new purpose, we will
notify you and communicate the legal basis which allows us to do so before
starting any new processing.

7\. Data sharing
----------------

**Why might you share my personal data with third parties?**

We will share your personal data with third parties where we are required by
law, where it is necessary to administer the relationship between us or where we
have another legitimate interest in doing so.

**Which third-party service providers process my personal data?**

“Third parties” include third-party service providers and advisors. The
following activities are carried out by third-party service providers: IT and
cloud services, professional advisory services, administration services,
bookkeeping and accounting, marketing services and banking services.

All of our third-party service providers are required to take commercially
reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal data. We
only permit our third-party service providers to process your personal data for
specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

8\. Transfers of personal data
------------------------------

The data that we collect from you may only be processed in locations which have
adequate protection. Whenever Smart360 stores and/or processed personal
information outside the EEA, it will do so on the basis of the EU standard
contractual clauses or the Privacy Shield Framework.

9\. Security controls
---------------------

We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from
loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction.
We have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and administrative
measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of
privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption.

We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors
and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
confidentiality.

We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security
breach and will notify our local [Data Protection Authority](https://oicjersey.org/breach-reporting/) of any suspected
breach within 72 hours where we are legally required to do so.

10\. Your rights 
----------------

**Your duty to inform us of changes**

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and
current. Should your personal information change, please notify us of any
changes of which we need to be made aware by contacting us, using the contact
details below.

**Your rights in connection with personal data**

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

-   **Request access to your personal data.** This enables you to receive
    details of personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
    processing it lawfully.

-   **Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.**

-   **Request erasure of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to
    delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
    continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
    remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to
    procession (see below).

-   **Object to processing of your personal data** where we are relying on a
    legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about
    your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on
    this basis. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
    personal information for direct marketing purposes.

-   **Request the restriction of processing of your personal data.** This
    enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you,
    for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
    processing it.

-   **Request the transfer of your personal data** to you or another data
    controller if the processing is based on consent, carried out by automated
    means and this is technically feasible.

If you want to exercise any of the above rights, please notify us using the
details at the end of this notice.

You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if
your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may
refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of
your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that
personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
it.

11\. Right to withdraw consent
------------------------------

In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the
collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose
(for example, in relation to direct marketing that you have indicated you would
like to receive from us), you have the right to withdraw your consent for that
specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please notify us
using the details at the end of this notice.

Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will
no longer process your personal information (personal data) for the purpose or
purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for
doing so in law.

control, or reorganization of all our part of our business.
